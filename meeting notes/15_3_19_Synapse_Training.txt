AMP-AD Synapse Training

Focus: query Synapse knowledge portal via R

want to use synapse queries more:
ampAd <- synQuery(‘select id, name, platform, disease from file where projectId ==\’syn2580853\’’)

#look with
ampAD[1:5,]

questions:
file name conventions doc
required annotation doc
clarity about what working versions to work with vs. released versions, and how to find them. How modify/correct released data?

How set up provenance with multiple outputs?

Is there a list that identifies synapse IDs of what’s been released, what’s created, what’s in progress, etc?
