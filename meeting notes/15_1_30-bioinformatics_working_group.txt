public release coming 2/16

much work to be done to make it more globally accessible

Mayo data:
are there additional annotation files?
James: not sure. What’s wrong with variable refs?
Ben L: want good column header definitions; sparse metadata. Will follow up specifically

Can’t release age > 90 (HIPPA), so that changes data.

Need to get clinical data organized for public release

Good to aggregate publication info for data sets - how to extract info from Mayo data papers (Nil and Steve)
