2/27 AMP AD bioinformatics WG call

first public release is now scheduled for March 4
public data portal walkthrough (starting from www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2580853

Note: next release looks like it’s May 2015 (then one in August 2015)

Next couple weeks: schedule tutorial on how to define provenance/annotation

Data must be deposited 6 weeks before release (so mid April)

We’re up to release MayoBB RNA-seq. What’s its status? (Mayo Brain Bank)
Status of MayoEGWAS eSNP results? - Ben L

Genotype imputation:
Mayo pipeline needs to be rerun (be sure to coordinate with  - Emory?)

Lilly has done, found issues. Post-processing important; easy to lose haplotype info if run with incorrect flags

Finally, analysis plans:
Ley - phil putting together RNAseq analysis group ROSMap. Timeline or analysis?
unknown for now

Something that would be useful: put DE analysis in synapse?
BL: pipeline and results would be great. And can control sharing settings.

Hope to build on each others’ studies without interference as far as publications

Ming Wei - Mt Saini analysis status? - Working on, will update analysis plans
